## Complex.java
+ This Java program defines a Complex class representing complex numbers.
+ It demonstrates the creation of complex number objects using these constructors, showcasing default, parametric, and copy constructor usage.
+  Additionally, it explicitly calls the finalize method to demonstrate manual object destruction and triggers garbage collection using System.gc().

## Constructor.java
+ This Java program defines a Vector class with default, parametric, and copy constructors, using an ArrayList<Integer> to store integers.

## ExceptionHandling.java
+ This Java program demonstrates exception handling with a user-defined exception.
+ The UserDefined class extends the Exception class, and the program defines a check method that throws this custom exception.
+ There is a try-catch block, catching the custom exception and printing a related message.
+ The finally block ensures execution of code regardless of whether an exception occurs, providing a concise overview of exception handling in Java.

## File.java
+ This Java program showcases file handling using FileOutputStream and FileInputStream.
+ It first writes to a file named "file.txt" using a PrintStream. It reads the content of the file using a FileInputStream and Scanner.
+ The program includes exception handling for FileNotFoundException.
+ Overall, it provides a concise overview of basic file input and output operations in Java.

## Inheritance.java
+ This Java program illustrates class inheritance and polymorphism in the context of a list, stack, and queue.
+ It defines three classes: List, Stack (inheriting from List), and Queue (inheriting from Stack).
+ The program showcases the principles of class inheritance, method overriding, and user interaction through a console-based application.

## Linkedhashmap.java
+ This Java program demonstrates the usage of LinkedHashMap to store key-value pairs.
+ It performs various operations like adding and retrieving values, checking size, emptiness, key and value presence, and removal.
+ The program showcases the flexibility and utility of LinkedHashMap in maintaining insertion order for key-value mappings.

## ListOfLists.java
+ This Java program defines a matrix class with constructors for default, parametric, and copy initialization.It uses an ArrayList of ArrayList<Integer> to represent a matrix.
+ The program demonstrates the creation and printing of matrices, including user input in the parametric constructor.
+ The main method in the ListOfLists class creates instances of the matrix class, showcasing object creation, printing, and finalization in a list of lists structure.

## Matrices.java
+ This Java program defines a matrix class representing matrices with default, parametric, and copy constructors. It uses a 2D array for matrix storage and includes methods for printing.
+ The Matrices class demonstrates object creation, user-input matrix initialization, and copy construction.
+ The program outputs matrices created through these constructors and displays messages upon object finalization.

## Overload.java
+ This Java program exemplifies method overloading for string concatenation.
+ The class Overload features three overloaded concatenate methods with different number of parameters.

## StackException.java
+ This Java program implements a stack using an array and handles stack overflow and underflow exceptions.
+ The st class contains methods for pushing and popping elements with exception handling for array boundaries.
+ The StackException class interacts with the user to perform push and pop operations on the stack, displaying appropriate messages for exceptions and ensuring a controlled stack behavior.
